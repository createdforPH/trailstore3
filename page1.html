                        <p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style display-7">Hello! Welcome to the Thera-Kitchen blog where I share all our DIY home-made artisan recipes from bath &amp; body to home living.<br><br>Here you can learn how you can create your own and customize them the way you like it! Before we start, let me tell you more about myself, to know more who's making these recipes and if you can relate with me.<br><br>I'm a registered nurse by profession, a full-time mom in my 40s. I have hypersensitivity to chemical and strong smell with an inborn scaly dry skin and natural wavy hair. My journey started when everything else failed me - I used and tried every product from the expensive Rustan's collection to the market stalls that also made diy products. Unfortunately, nothing worked for me - maybe because different individuals have different needs and flaws.<br><br>I was introduced to natural organic products when I tried a conditioner eco-bar and I was amazed how natural products give genuine results to my natural dry colored wavy curls. Somehow I feel that there's something lacking - so I embarked on this journey to tend my own needs - and somehow help with yours as well.<br><br>Hope you enjoy this blog. I would be glad to connect with you all!ðŸ’‹<br><br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-text align-left mbr-fonts-style display-7">Since the reason to start my journey is my experience with a conditioner bar - here's my first recipe that would fit all kinds of hair types. I've tried it personally on my own and it worked wonderfully with my dry frizzy wavy curls. My husband Paul also tried this bar up to its last lather and we're both hooked on using it. After our experience, we no longer wanted to use commercially store-bought conditioner from the supermarket. I've decided to share this recipe with you so you can experience it on your own - or just buy it from OUR STORE !<br><br>Using ALL-NATURAL ingredients means we've used plant-based and naturally occurring extracts and minerals. Using grapeseed oil and aloevera extract is my first choice to nourish hair from super dry to oily type, it's the most basic conditioner bar for normal hair to maintain it's texture and over-all health. These power-duo protects the hair from sun damage, deeply hydrates &amp; conditions while promoting hair growth &amp; strengthening each strand while maintaining oil balance. <br><br>INGREDIENTS:<br><em><strong>(heat phase)</strong></em><br>15     % 4.94g  mango butter<br>24     % 7.92g  btms 50<br>  2     % 0.66g  beeswax<br>30.    % 7.92g  cetearyl alcohol<br>  0.83% 0.27g  allantoin<br>  5.    % 1.65g  grapeseed<br><em><strong>(cool-down phase)</strong></em><br>11.70% 3.86g  fractionated coconut oil<br>  2.50% 0.83g  aloe vera extract<br>  2     % 0.66g  rice bran oil<br>  a pinch of.      mica dye (optional)<br><em><strong>(pre-pouring)</strong></em><br>  3     % 0.99g  fragrance oil (optional)<br><br>In every procedure, I highly recommend to measure all your ingredients first and ready all your tools. I measure all my heat phase ingredients directly to a heat-resistant borosilicate glass bowl (best one is the Pyrex glass bowl). In a separate container, measure all the cool-down phase and another bowl for the fragrance oil since the scent was greatly affected by heat - it's best to mix your fragrance just a few seconds before pouring to your mold.<br><br>Using a casserole, (where your heat-resistant glass bowl can fit) ready a water bath just enough to reach the ingredients inside your glass bowl. Turn the stove on into medium heat as your heat phase ingredients melt. It would only take about 2-5 minutes before your heat phase ingredients melt. Have an infrared thermometer ready within reach to check the temperature of your mixture - take note to keep the temperature not higher than 85 degrees celsius.<br><br>Once melted, you can take out your glass bowl and place it on top of a table cloth to keep it warm or you can keep it on the stove (but make sure to keep the temperature not higher than 70 degrees celsius). Immediately pour your cool down phase ingredients and stir throughly, making sure to dissolve any lumps.<br><br>Ready your mold, I spray it with isopropyl rubbing alcohol, but this is optional.<br>Pour your fragrance oil to your mixture, make a quick stir and pour to your molds. You can spray the surface with isopropyl rubbing alcohol to avoid bubble formation.<br><br>To use your lightweight eco-conditioner bar, rub or apply into wet hair just like a regular conditioner. It is best to use a soap mesh like this to form more lather while keeping your bar dry in the shower when hanged.<br><br>Enjoy and experience soft and beautiful hair with every wash while saving the planet with a zero-waste conditioner bar!<br><br><strong>SUBSTITUTIONS</strong><br>You can use other butters, but I recommend shea butter which has the closest hardness and melting property of the mango butter.<br>Btms 50 is quite difficult to replace, you can only swap it with btms 25 which will only give you half the moisturizing property that can benefit people with oily hair.<br>Beeswax is a very common material and readily available everywhere. Cetearyl alcohol can be replaced with a combination of cetyl alcohol and stearic acid to form your fatty alcohol and acid at 6:4 ratio (6, cetyl alcohol: 4, stearic acid).<br>Allantoin is a natural source of panthenol B5, you can use your panthenol B5 or another natural source like the comfrey extract.<br>Grapeseed gives the lightweight moisturizing property of this bar, but you can swap it with other light oils that you prefer.<br>Fractionated coconut oil provides additional lather to this bar so if you're planning to replace it, try using other lathering oils like coconut or castor oil.<br>Aloevera extract is the one that gives this bar an exceptional hydrating feature, I highly recommend not to swap this since you can easily acquire this in the supermarket or from your garden. You can try using cucumber extract instead if you still wish to replace this extract.<br>Rice bran oil is the natural alternative for Vitamin E acetate, you can use your vitamin e if using synthetic raw material is not a problem for you.<br>Mica dye &amp; fragrance oil are just cosmetic ingredients for a colorful and aromatic bars. If you have hypersensitive skin, I recommend you to skip this and just replace the fragrance oil with other hair-loving oils.<br><br></p>
